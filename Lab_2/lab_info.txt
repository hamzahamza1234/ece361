New msg types:

msg               type       source                        data
/invite            14      the sending client's name        the client that we are inviting
/accept            15      the client's name                the session they are joining
/decline           16      the client's name                empty
/priv              17      the sending client's name        the recieving client's name and the message with a space in between
/p_valid           18      the server (zero)                empty (il print user found in client)
/p_invalid         19      the server(zero)                 empty (il print user not found in client)

all 4 implemented in client and skeleton in server

the priv message only works with user hamza for now due to line 721 in server, caitlin needs to implement that 

the p_valid and p_invalid are two acks i decided to add because we want to notify the private message sender if 
the user they entered exists, if the user they enetered doesnt exists, the message will not be sent and so we can notify them with the p_invalid acks
. I already implemented this in the client asw and wrong a basic skeleton in the server.
