We have implemented 2 new features for our Text Conferencing App

Feature 1: Private Messages
Any user can send Private messages to any other user using :  /priv <user_name> <message>

This feature works regardless of if any of the users are in a session are not. This is a very useful feature as a user might want
to communicate confidential information with another client but not the entire group. We implemented this by making the new message types 
17, 18 and 19 (shown in table above).

When a user wants to send a message, the client sends packet type 17 to the server and they recieves
a p_valid or a p_invalid depending on if the recieveing user exists.

Feature 2: Session Invites
Any user that is in a session can invite another user that is not in a session using : /invite <user_name>

In order to implement this feature, we have created 3 new message types 14, 15 and 16 (shown in table above)

The invite will only work if the user sending the invite is in a session and if the user getting invited is not in a session.
If the sender is not in a session, it will notify them that they cant invite anyone unless they are in a session. 
If the reciever is in a session, they will not recieve the invite as they are already in a session

If the invitation criteria are met, the reciever will have the option to either /accept <session_name> or /decline the invitation. 
If they accept, they will join the session and if they decline, they will not.
