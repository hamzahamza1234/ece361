/accept            15      the client's name                the session they are joining
/decline           16      the client's name                empty
/priv              17      the sending client's name        the recieving client's name and the message with a space in between
/p_valid           18      the server (zero)                empty (il print user found in client)
/p_invalid         19      the server(zero)                 empty (il print user not found in client)

all 4 implemented in client and skeleton in server

the priv message only works with user hamza for now due to line 663, caitlin needs to implement that
